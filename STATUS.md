# Backend Development Status

This document tracks the progress of the Tagline backend (FastAPI) implementation. Each milestone below represents a major step toward a robust, production-ready API.

## Current Status

- [x] Set up CI for automated testing
- [x] Scaffold minimal FastAPI application
- [x] Integrate persistent storage (database)
    - [x] Choose database library/ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy)
    - [x] Add environment variable for DB connection string (`DATABASE_URL`)
        - [x] If not set, default to SQLite file (e.g., `sqlite:///./tagline.db`)
        - [x] Document this in README and .env.example
    - [x] Implement database connection logic in FastAPI app
        - [x] Read connection string from env/config
        - [x] Configure SQLAlchemy engine/session accordingly
        - [x] Handle SQLite-specific options (e.g., check_same_thread)
    - [x] Define database schema/models:
        - [x] Photo metadata (ID, filename, description, timestamps, etc.)
        - [x] Refresh tokens (for revocation/token store)
    - [x] Set up database session dependency injection for FastAPI routes
        - [x] Implemented `get_db` dependency in `tagline_backend_app/db/session.py`. Ready for use in all future FastAPI routes.
    - [x] Implement migrations (e.g., Alembic)
        - [x] Create initial migration scripts
        - [x] Document migration workflow
    - [x] Write CRUD utility functions/repositories for:
        - [x] Photo metadata
        - [x] Refresh tokens
    - [x] Document database setup, connection string usage, and defaults
- [x] Add file storage for photos
    - [x] Define a storage provider interface/abstract base class (e.g., `PhotoStorageProvider`)

    - [x] Implement local filesystem provider (MVP)
        - [x] Store photos in a configurable directory (env var, e.g., `FILESYSTEM_STORAGE_PATH`)
    - [x] Implement provider selection logic
        - [x] Add environment variable to select storage provider (e.g., `STORAGE_PROVIDER=filesystem`)
        - [x] Load/configure provider at app startup based on env/config
        - [x] Document this in README and .env.example
